📌 Notes
Make sure to place all image and video assets (e.g., hero.mp4, logo.png, card1.avif, etc.) in the same directory or update the paths in index.html accordingly.

Some properties in script.js (like opesity) have small typos that can be fixed for better consistency (opacity instead of opesity).
